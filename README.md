# *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* Mash Database Generator
## An automated GitHub Actions workflow for creating up-to-date *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* mash sketch databases for strain analysis

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow designed to automatically build a comprehensive and up-to-date Mash sketch database from all available *S. cerevisiae* genomes, as well as genomes of other species as outgroups. This project was created to provide a fully automated, cloud-based method to generate a fresh Mash sketch database for *S. cerevisiae* strain analysis on demand, without requiring massive local computation or storage resources.

The workflow was adapted from [mcs383/Fungal-RefSeq-Mash-Database-Generator](https://github.com/mcs383/Fungal-RefSeq-Mash-Database-Generator) and [erinyoung/update_mash_dist](https://github.com/erinyoung/update_mash_dist) to support a yeast genomics project as a reusable resource for the yeast community.

## How it Works

This repository uses a single workflow (`.github/workflows/build_database.yml`) that automates the entire process using GitHub's own servers. The workflow consists of three main jobs that run in sequence:

1.  **Job 1: `list_genomes`**
    * Connects to the NCBI database and downloads a complete list of accession numbers for all currently available *S. cerevisiae* reference genomes (NCBI `taxon 4932`).
    * Splits this master list into 10 smaller "chunk" files to enable parallel processing.
    * Uploads these chunk files as an artifact for the next job.

2.  **Job 2: `create_sketches`**
    * This is a parallel matrix job that runs 10 jobs simultaneously.
    * Each job is assigned one of the "chunk" files.
    * It processes its list one genome at a time in a disk-efficient loop: it downloads a single genome, creates a Mash sketch, merges it into a combined sketch for the chunk, and then deletes the downloaded files before starting the next one. This is crucial for running within the disk space limits of the GitHub servers.
    * Each job uploads its completed partial sketch as an artifact.

3.  **Job 3: `combine_sketches`**
    * This final job runs only after all 10 sketching jobs are complete.
    * It downloads all 10 of the partial sketch artifacts.
    * It uses `mash paste` to merge them into one final, comprehensive database sketch file.
    * It then compresses the final sketch and creates a formal **GitHub Release**, attaching the file for easy download.

## How to Use This Workflow

1.  **Fork this Repository:** Create your own copy of this repository by clicking the "Fork" button.
2.  **Enable Actions:** Go to the "Actions" tab of your newly forked repository. You may need to click a button to enable workflows.
3.  **Run the Workflow:**
    * In the Actions tab, select **"Build Fungal RefSeq Database"** from the list of workflows on the left.
    * Click the **"Run workflow"** button on the right.
    * You will be prompted to enter a **version tag** of the current version of the RefSeq database (e.g. `v230`, `v231`, etc.). This tag will be used to label your final release.
    * Click the final green **"Run workflow"** button.
4.  **Wait:** The process will take a few hours to complete. You can close your browser and computer; the job will continue running on GitHub's servers. You can monitor its progress on the "Actions" tab at any time.
5.  **Download Your Database:** When the workflow is complete (it will have a green checkmark âœ…), go to the main page of your repository. On the right-hand side, click on **"Releases"**. Your new database will be there, attached as a `.msh.gz` file, ready to download.

## Once downloaded ensure the numebr of sketches matches the number of genomes in the current RefSeq Database

***Verifying the Database Contents***

To ensure your downloaded or newly-built Mash sketch file is complete, you can compare the number of genomes it contains with the current number of reference genomes available on NCBI.

***Step 1: Get the Current Genome Count from NCBI***

First, find out how many fungal reference genomes NCBI currently has in its database. This command queries the database directly. (Note: you must have the `ncbi-datasets-cli` tool installed and in your `PATH`).

```bash
datasets summary genome taxon 4751 --reference | grep "total_count"
This should print a line that looks something like this. Take note of the number.

  "total_count": 5088
```
  
***Step 2: Count the Genomes in Your Sketch File***

Next, use the mash info command to count how many individual genomes are inside your .msh file. Make sure you are in the directory containing your sketch file.

```bash
# Replace Your_Sketch_File.msh with your actual file name
mash info -t Your_Sketch_File.msh | wc -l
This will print a single number, which is the total count of sketches in your file.
```

***Step 3: Compare the Numbers***

The number from Step 2 should be identical or very close to the total_count from Step 1. If they match, your database is verified and ready to use!
